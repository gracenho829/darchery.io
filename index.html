Big Idea :

Darchery : Darts + Archery
A scaled down version of archery where the players throw darts at an archery target, and the points for each player are tracked and displayed on a web server. The settings could be configured such that numerous games could be played.

Parts Needed:
Dart board
Darts
Tin Foil 
Cardboard 
Pi 
Touch Sensor
iPad / smart device 

Timeline : 
November 7 - November 10: Test out mini model of “Darchery” 
⇒ Determine if we need to stick with Darchery or Fall - Back Plan 
November 10- November 14: Gather materials needed for bigger version of “Darchery” 
November 15 - November 18: Build the actual version of “Darchery” (prototype and video demo)
November 21 - November 22/23 : Team’s functional check off
November 28 - December 2 : Prepare the documentation / presentation 

Risks/Contingencies:
Board can’t recognize getting hit by dart
Difficult to connect with the server 
Sensor might be slow to respond ⇒ actions may not be synchronized

Fall - Back Plan :  
Whack-A-Mole  |  Mini Golf
